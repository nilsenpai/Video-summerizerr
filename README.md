# üéûÔ∏è Video Summarizer using Ollama + LangChain

This project allows you to **upload a video**, extract key **frames at intervals**, and generate a **concise summary** using **Ollama's LLM via LangChain**.

## üß† Key Features

- ‚úÖ Upload `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, or `.mkv` video files
- üñºÔ∏è Extracts frames at regular intervals (default: every 5 seconds)
- üîç Uses LangChain + Ollama (e.g. Gemma 3 4B model) to summarize video content
- üìÑ Simple and clean Streamlit UI

## üîß How It Works

1. **Upload** a video file via the Streamlit UI.
2. **Frames** are extracted at intervals using OpenCV.
3. The extracted frames are passed to an LLM with image binding support (`OllamaLLM`).
4. The model **generates a textual summary** based on visual content.

## üì¶ Requirements

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install streamlit opencv-python langchain langchain_community
```

> **Note**: You must have Ollama installed and running locally with a model that supports image input (e.g., `gemma3:4b`). To start Ollama:

```bash
ollama run gemma3:4b
```

## üèÅ How to Run

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
video_summerizerr/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ videos/         # Uploaded videos are saved here
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ frames/         # Extracted frames from video
```

## üìå Notes

- Make sure your Ollama model is properly named. `gemma3:4b` is used as a placeholder ‚Äî update if necessary.
- Frame extraction interval can be configured in the `extract_frames()` function.
